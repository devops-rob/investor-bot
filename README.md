# Twitch Investor App

As featured on the [DevOps Rob YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/devopsrob), this web application implements event driven investment using [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/devopsrob) events as the trigger and [Coinbase Pro](http://coinbase.com/join/barnes_xo4?src=android-link) as the crypto exchange that makes the investments.

The video below explains the concept in more detail.
